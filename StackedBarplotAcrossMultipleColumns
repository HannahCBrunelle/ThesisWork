# Hanna's goal
# show the different parasitization levels (not parasitized, low, medium and high)
# and the different parasite species. This would mean I would need to run multiple columns to create this bar plot.

# you can make your data in the "long" format so that the taxa groups are now a variable
# the gather() function allows you to do that, can explain how on Monday
